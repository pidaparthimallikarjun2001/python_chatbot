# TEAM PROJECT(3 members)
18pa1a05c6@vishnu.edu.in P N S S D Mallikarjun worked on functions mental_health(), return_quote(), bot(), start() and some other functions related to mental health</br> 
18pa1a0565@vishnu.edu.in K Neelaveni worked on functions exercise(), food() and some other functions related to physical health and diet</br>
16pa1a04c1@vishnu.edu.in N Devi Vara Prasad worked on functions greet(), welcome(name), findBMI(), and some other functions.
We divided the whole concept int 3 things and we created different python files for specific functions and finally we integrated them through function calls as shown in the below image.
# WHAT IT DOES
This is a chatbot which helps you to manage your physical and mental fitness as well. 
If the user selects mental fitness, it motivates the user by telling a random quote and it also tells us some ways to overcome fear and depression.
If the user selects physical fitness, 
it asks for 2 things: 1. Exercise and 2. Diet plan
In both these cases, it asks the user to enter his weight(in kgs) and height(in cms) and it calculates his/her BMI(Body Mass Index)
According to his / her BMI, the bot tells us what to eat and what exercise to do in order to be healthy both physically and mentally.
